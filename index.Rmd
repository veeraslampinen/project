# Veera Lampinen

I am a current postgraduate taught student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/), currently working with [Dr Chiara Horlin](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychologyneuroscience/staff/chiarahorlin/).

## Research Interests 

I am interested in researching the lived experiences of queer and neurodivergent students in higher education. More speficially, my current project is exploring how student who identify as both queer and neurodivergent experience the intersection of both identities in relation to higher education.
