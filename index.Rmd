I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/).
I work with [Chiara Horlin](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychologyneuroscience/staff/chiarahorlin/). lol

I am interested in researching the lived experiences of queer and neurodivergent students in higher education.
